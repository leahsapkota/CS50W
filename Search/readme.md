CS50W SEARCH PROJECT-0

OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this Google Search project is to design a front-end interface for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search that mimics Google’s functionality and aesthetics. You will create forms to submit search queries to Google using GET parameters, understanding how URLs encode form data. Additionally, you’ll implement features like navigation links, a “Feeling Lucky” button, and advanced search options while styling the pages to match Google’s minimalist design. This project enhances skills in HTML, CSS, and form handling while deepening your understanding of web development concepts.

The Requirements For This Project:

1.Three Pages: 
One for regular Google Search, one for Google Image Search amd one for Advanced Search.

2.Navigation:
The Google Search page includes links that allow users to switch to the Image Search or Advanced Search pages. Similarly, the Image Search and Advanced Search pages provide links to navigate back to the main Google Search page.

3.Google Search Page
The Google Search page lets users enter a query, click "Google Search," and view the results. The search bar should be centered with rounded corners, and the search button should be centered below it, resembling Google's design.

4.Google Image Search Page:
Image Search Page:
The Google Image Search page allows users to enter a search query, click a button to initiate the search, and view the corresponding Google Image search results for their input.

5.Google Advanced Search page:
The Google Advanced Search page provides fields for users to refine their searches. Users can specify pages that must include all given words, match an exact word or phrase, contain any of several words, or exclude pages with specific words.

6."I'm Feeling Lucky" Button:
Add an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button to the search page that takes users directly to the first Google search result, skipping the results page. A redirect notice may appear due to Google’s security features, which is normal.

7.CSS Asthetics:
The CSS should emulate Google's clean and minimalist design, featuring a centered search bar with rounded corners and simple, visually appealing buttons. Fonts, colors, and spacing should align with Google's modern aesthetic for a familiar user experience.
