Objective: The Objective of this Wiki Project is to create an online Wikipedia-like encyclopedia website consisting of entry, index, search, new page , edit page as well as random pages.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have met all these requirements below:

1.Entry Page: Visiting /wiki/TITLE should display a page with the contents of the encyclopedia entry specified by TITLE, fetched using the appropriate utility function.

2.Index Page: Modify index.html so that each encyclopedia entry name is displayed as a clickable link, allowing users to navigate directly to the corresponding entry page.

3.Search Page: Enable users to search for encyclopedia entries by typing a query into the sidebar search box.
If the query matches an entry's name, redirect the user to that entry's page.
If the query doesn't match exactly, display a search results page listing all entries that contain the query as a substring (e.g., searching "ytho" would include "Python").
Ensure that clicking on any entry name in the search results redirects the user to that specific entry's page.

4.New Page:Clicking "Create New Page" in the sidebar should navigate the user to a page for creating a new encyclopedia entry.
The page should allow users to input a title and enter Markdown content for the entry in a textarea.
A "Save" button should let users save their new entry.
If an entry with the same title already exists, display an error message to the user. Otherwise, save the entry and redirect the user to the newly created page.

5.Edit Page:Each entry page should include a link that takes the user to an edit page for modifying the entry's Markdown content.
The edit page should feature a textarea pre-filled with the current Markdown content of the entry.
Users should have the option to save their changes by clicking a button.
After saving, the user should be redirected back to the updated entry's page.

6.Random Page: Clicking on the "Random Page" in the sidebar should take users to different pages from the encyclopedia everytime you click on the "Random Page".

7.Markdown to Html-Conversion :On each entryâ€™s page, any Markdown content in the entry file should be converted to HTML before being displayed to the user. 

My Project has met all the given requirements, Thank You!
